        uint is always greater or equal to 0.

        We have set sender address balance to 100. And we require to check that transfer occour only
        when sender has sufficient balance to send money i.e balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value >= 0. But due to interger overflow 
        reasons that we explained above condition balanceOf[msg.sender] - _value >= 0 is always true. Thus sender can transfer 
        any amount to destination address.
